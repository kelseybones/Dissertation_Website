            <section class="two">This first part of my essay will be split into three smaller sections. In the first section I will start by looking at what makes a good user
              experience. I will provide a summary and use case studies from the ‘Nielsen Norman Group’ (Nielsen Norman Group, 2017) website to explain and highlight best practices and standards for a good user experience. I will also go over and explain the ten usability heuristics which were written by Jakob Nielsen. I will then go on to summarise the most popular psychology principles used in interface design, I will refer to 'Influence the psychology of persuasion’ (Cialdini, R.B, 2007) to introduce the principle and 'Webs of influence' (Nahai, N, 2017) to show how these principles are often applied to our website designs. 'Webs of influence' (Nahai, N, 2017) will also provide me with a number of case studies to refer to.</section><br><br>
              <section class="three">The second section will cover one main case study based on work I have carried out myself, my main case study will be that of Madlug (Madlug, 2017). Madlug is a charity that sells bags online and for every bag purchased they donate a duffle bag to a child in care. I was brought on board to improve the user experience of the e-commerce website and will provide statistics on how the interface changes affected conversion. I will highlight the influence psychology principles applied for this case study and reference them using 'Influence the psychology of persuasion’ (Cialdini, R.B, 2007) and ‘webs of influence’ (Nahai, N, 2017) to show how other sites have used the same principles.</section><br><br>
              <section class="four">In the final section I will provide a number of smaller case studies on how these same principles are being used across the web to get the user to buy products or sign up for free trials. I will base my investigation on normal businesses that are trying to make a profit and pay their employees. I will attempt to show how the psychology participles they are applying are the same as the charity website, but how one site is trying to get you to do a good deed and another is trying to get you to purchase their products to increase profits. I will begin to explore the theory that there is a scale of acceptability. That though both these businesses are employing the same techniques, are they morally on the same level? When does the amount of influence we are applying become unacceptable and is the answer to this question different depending on the circumstances?This first part of my essay will be split into three smaller sections.

            <h3 class="two">01 —— User Experience</h3>
            <section class="three">To start looking at the question ‘When Does Good User Experience Become Evil?’ You first have to understand what user experience is. The Nielsen Norman Group is one of the leading voices in UX and one of the first places to go to when learning about user experience design. nngroup.com describes user experience as ‘encompassing all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.’<br><br>When I started my placement one of the first things I was shown was Jakob Nielsen's ’10 general principles for interaction design.’ These are also known as ‘heuristics’. They are taken as general guidelines on how designers can ensure the usability of their design is good and consistent. These ten heuristics are: Visibility of system status, match between system and the real world, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, flexibility and efficiency of use, aesthetic and minimalist design, error recovery and finally help and documentation. When understood and applied correctly these principles can be the only thing a designer needs to create a good user experience.<br><br>These are very broad terms and you could write a whole essay on each of them. But I want to concentrate on a number of these guidelines, such as consistency and standards. Because not only do these heuristics fall into good usability, they also fall under the psychological principles of persuasion.<br><br>The ‘psychological principles of persuasion’ are 6 main persuasion techniques explored by the psychologist Robert Cialdini. These techniques are common themes that all fall under the umbrella of influence. Robert Cialdini outlines the 6 main principles of persuasion in ‘Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion’. These are;<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><B>Reciprocation.</B> Literally give and take. That when someone does something for you, you are indebted to them in a way that means you are more likely to agree to requests. In ‘Influence’ Cialdini reinforces the power of this principle by boldly stating that; ‘there is no human society that does not subscribe to this rule.’ Not only that but it is one of the reasons humans have thrived. Which is a pretty big statement. </li>
                    <li><B>Commitment and Consistency.</B> People strive to be consistent even if it means changing their opinion or choice to remain consistent. This rule is often used in conjunction with brand messaging. Brands want to portray a specific type of person who will buy their product. When this matches what a user perceives themselves to be they are more likely to purchase the product, as it reinforces their self-image.</li>
                    <li><B>Social Proof.</B> The idea that we take and mimic cues on what to do from other people. This is a big influence in web design, you can see it when e-commerce sites post reviews, or when charities ‘suggest’ the average amount that people choose to donate. </li>
                    <li><B>Liking.</B> We are more likely to comply with requests made by people that we like. This means both attractiveness and personality. Using attractive models or ‘aspirational’ people in your images and advertising, can influence users to think they like and item more than they would if the item were to be presented by itself. Social media influencers are often utilised for this principle as well as for the Authority principle. </li>
                    <li><B>Authority.</B> When we are unsure of what to do (or buy) we look for authorities in that area and are more likely to believe what they have to say, simply because they are an ‘authority’. Companies have harnessed this principle through the use of advertising with the likes of ‘beauty gurus’ on YouTube (youtube.com) and using them as brand ambassadors for their company. </li>
                    <li><B>Scarcity.</B> Literally: We want what we can’t have. Perceived scarcity of something makes us automatically put a higher value on the item. Thus making it more desirable. This is another big one used in e-commerce. Companies employ a few different methods to utilise this principle. Such as telling the user there is only ‘x’ amount left in stock or calling an item ‘limited edition’. </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>I want to look at how these principles are being applied in design and how common it is to use these principles in our designs. Even when we are unaware that we are doing so. How much influence do these principles actually have on users and what sort of effect can it have on things like conversion rate and transactions.

            <h3>02 —— Madlug a Case Study</h3>
            <section>This first part of my essay will be split into three smaller sections. In the first section I will start by looking at what makes a good user experience. I will provide a summary and use case studies from the ‘Nielsen Norman Group’ (Nielsen Norman Group, 2017) website to explain and highlight best practices and standards for a good user experience. I will also go over and explain the ten usability heuristics which were written by Jakob Nielsen. I will then go on to summarise the most popular psychology principles used in interface design, I will refer to 'Influence the psychology of persuasion’ (Cialdini, R.B, 2007) to introduce the principle and 'Webs of influence' (Nahai, N, 2017) to show how these principles are often applied to our website designs. 'Webs of influence' (Nahai, N, 2017) will also provide me with a number of case studies to refer to.</section><br>
            <section>The second section will cover one main case study based on work I have carried out myself, my main case study will be that of Madlug (Madlug, 2017). Madlug is a charity that sells bags online and for every bag purchased they donate a duffle bag to a child in care. I was brought on board to improve the user experience of the e-commerce website and will provide statistics on how the interface changes affected conversion. I will highlight the influence psychology principles applied for this case study and reference them using 'Influence the psychology of persuasion’ (Cialdini, R.B, 2007) and ‘webs of influence’ (Nahai, N, 2017) to show how other sites have used the same principles.</section><br>
            <section>In the final section I will provide a number of smaller case studies on how these same principles are being used across the web to get the user to buy products or sign up for free trials. I will base my investigation on normal businesses that are trying to make a profit and pay their employees. I will attempt to show how the psychology participles they are applying are the same as the charity website, but how one site is trying to get you to do a good deed and another is trying to get you to purchase their products to increase profits. I will begin to explore the theory that there is a scale of acceptability. That though both these businesses are employing the same techniques, are they morally on the same level? When does the amount of influence we are applying become unacceptable and is the answer to this question different depending on the circumstances?This first part of my essay will be split into three smaller sections.

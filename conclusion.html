        <h3>01 —— What does it all mean?</h3>
        <p>
            I have spoken about how we have to be careful to not overly use persuasion techniques and to be aware of what we are doing when designing an interface. But I haven’t touched on other ways in which a designer can increase conversion without using these techniques. One way to ensure you have done absolutely everything in your power to increase conversion, without overly influencing your users, is to make sure the usability of your website follows good user experience standards. Check your designs against the ten usability heuristics and use usability tests to get an unbiased opinion. These techniques can help highlight areas that need to be improved before resorting to more extreme measures.<br><br>
            
            However, implementing changes such as the $300M button is not always doable on every project. Designers must look at each project as a stand alone and decide from there how much influence is acceptable to apply. For example, when faced with designing a charities website, should a designer use all the tools and influences at their disposal to get people to donate more money to charity? And is this different from working with the likes of MVMT or again from working with retail giants like Amazon, who have the capabilities to influence not only it’s users, but the design of what is considered best practice across the web? <br><br>
            
            This thought indicates that there is a spectrum of acceptability when implementing influence principles on web designs. It is not a case of one size fits all when looking at these principles. Designers must educate themselves on the patterns that they are using and where they come from in order to understand how much influence they can have over their users. Only the designer of a project will be able to tell what is morally acceptable and where to draw the line in the sand. They must learn how to balance these principles with good usability all while trying to see what else they may be able to change to make it easer for users to complete their tasks.<br><br>
            
            Using psychology as a method of persuasion in web design is a powerful tool and should be approached with both knowledge and caution. As Edward E. Murrow says; “To be persuasive we must be believable, to be believable we must be credible and to be credible we must be truthful.”

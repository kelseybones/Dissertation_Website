        <article>As a designer I have always thought that a good user experience was unquestionably morally right. The user is happy because the interface makes it easy for them to complete the task they started, the business can reach their financial goals and stay in business. </article>

        <h3>01 —— Where it all started</h3>
        <article>When I started my placement this year with a user experience agency, my knowledge of UX was limited, to the brief overview I had been given in the second year of my degree. I knew that as a designer, you should always aim to create a good user experience. I had encountered websites with awful user experience and wanted to make sure my designs never caused people the sort of frustration I had felt previously, when using a confusing interface. On top of this a good user experience is beneficial for businesses. It can increase user conversion by creating a frictionless user journey through the site or app. Increasing conversion, increases profits. So the benefits are two fold. The user is happy because they had a frictionless experience and the business is happy because it’s hitting it's KPI's. </article><br>
        <article>After a few months of working I started to realise that the designs and suggestions we were making to our clients were almost always the same. We talked about having contact information always available to the user, as this increased trust in the company. Having reviews from past customers can help users feel well informed and therefore support their decision to purchase. These things all seemed logical and very straight forward. It was only after the head of UX shared an interesting infographic from digitalsynopsis.com that I started to realise that these ‘best practices’ in design, were actually based in psychology principles. And that we, as a team, were using psychology to influence users behaviour. </article><br>
        <article>I was unsure of exactly how much these specific design patterns were influencing the users. But I did know how much conversion usually increased after our suggestions and designs were implemented on a website. And after all, our clients were the businesses and our main goal was to help them increase conversion. At this point I put it out of my mind, it was an interesting topic but I didn’t feel the need to learn more about it. </article><br>
        <article>It was only this year when I came across an article by Adobe on ‘The Morality of Manipulation’ that I started to think about it more. It opened my eyes to the idea that as a designer it is my job to consider the impact of my design. As Tobias Van Schnider says in his article; “The role as a designer, or even as an engineer has become more influential and powerful than ever. The work we do makes an impact and naturally brings up the discussion around ethics, responsibility and accountability.”</article> <br>
        <article>I started to wonder; how much influence is acceptable for us as designers to employ on our users?
